Outfit Recommendation Logic for an AI API system needs to handle several aspects to ensure relevant and accurate outfit suggestions based on a user's wardrobe, weather, and occasion. Here's a possible implementation outline, broken down into functions:
1. Input Data Structure:
The API should receive input data structured as a JSON object:
{
  "wardrobe": [
    { "itemId": "shirt1", "type": "top", "imageUrl": "...", "description": "..." },
    { "itemId": "jeans1", "type": "bottom", "imageUrl": "...", "description": "..." },
    // ... more wardrobe items
  ],
  "temperature": 20,  // Celsius
  "occasion": "casual",
  "stylePreference": "modern" //Optional: Allows for more tailored results.
}
Use code with caution.

2. Core Logic Functions:
get_outfit_suggestions(wardrobe, temperature, occasion, stylePreference): This is the main function. It orchestrates the other functions.
filter_wardrobe_by_weather(wardrobe, temperature): This function filters the user's wardrobe based on the temperature. It removes items unsuitable for the given temperature (e.g., shorts in cold weather). It could also prioritize certain items (e.g., heavier coats in cold weather).
filter_wardrobe_by_occasion(wardrobe, occasion): This function filters the wardrobe to include only items appropriate for the given occasion (e.g., formal wear for a wedding, casual wear for a picnic).
generate_outfit_combinations(filteredWardrobe): This is where the AI model's role is crucial. It takes the filtered wardrobe items as input and generates a list of outfit combinations. The AI should consider factors such as color harmony, style consistency, and item compatibility (e.g., a formal shirt doesn't go with sweatpants). This would likely use a machine learning model (trained on fashion data).
recommend_outwear(outfit, temperature): If the temperature is below a certain threshold (e.g., 14Â°C), this function adds an appropriate outerwear item (jacket, coat) to the outfit. It should select from items in the wardrobe that are suitable for outerwear, prioritising items that would complement the existing outfit. If no suitable outerwear is available in the user's wardrobe, a message could be sent to inform the user.
add_accessories(outfit): This function adds accessories to enhance the outfit. The selection of accessories could be based on the existing outfit and style preferences.
rank_outfits(outfits): This function ranks the generated outfits based on factors like color harmony, style consistency, and overall aesthetic appeal. The ranking could be based on the scores given by the AI model.
3. API Response:
The API should return a JSON response containing the recommended outfits:
{
  "outfits": [
    {
      "outfitId": "outfit1",
      "items": [
        { "itemId": "shirt1", "type": "top", "imageUrl": "..." },
        { "itemId": "jeans1", "type": "bottom", "imageUrl": "..." },
        // ... other items
      ],
      "score": 0.85 // AI's confidence score for this outfit
    },
    // ... more outfits
  ]
}
Use code with caution.

4. AI Model Integration:
The AI model (likely a neural network) would be trained on a vast dataset of clothing items, their attributes (color, style, material), and images of stylish outfits. The model learns to predict combinations of items that look good together. This would be integrated into the generate_outfit_combinations function. There are several ways to integrate the model:
Direct integration: The AI model runs directly on the server. This requires more resources but offers lower latency.
Cloud API: The model is hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform), and the API interacts with it through REST calls or gRPC.
5. Error Handling:
The system needs to handle errors gracefully. This includes handling cases where the AI fails to generate outfits, there are no suitable items in the wardrobe, or the API call fails.
